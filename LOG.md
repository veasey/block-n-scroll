Seed and schem data added.

Features required:
- [ ] partial names list, need to check that faction list exists. If positional does not exist, default to linemen, if no lineman for faction default to human names list.
- [ ] require a way to input names for admins, and request additional names from coaches.

Need to fix script that runs schema and seed files.
Next week just focus on schema and data.
