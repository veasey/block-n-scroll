    <h2>Dauntless</h2>

    <p>A player with this skill is capable of psyching himself up so 
    he can take on even the very strongest opponent. The skill only 
    works when the player attempts to block an opponent who is 
    stronger than himself. When the skill is used, the coach of the 
    player with the Dauntless skill rolls a D6 and adds it to his 
    strength. If the total is equal to or lower than the opponent's 
    Strength, the player must block using his normal Strength. If the
    total is greater, then the player with the Dauntless skill counts 
    as having a Strength equal to his opponent's when he makes the 
    block. The strength of both players is calculated before any 
    defensive or offensive assists are added but after all other 
    modifiers.</p>
