    <h2>Piling On</h2>

    <p>The player may use this skill after he has made a block as part of one of his Block or Blitz
    Actions, but only if the Piling On player is currently standing adjacent to the victim and the
    victim was Knocked Down. You may re-roll the Armour roll or Injury roll for the victim. The
    Piling On player is Placed Prone in his own square â€” it is assumed that he rolls back there after
    flattening his opponent (do not make an Armour roll for him as he has been cushioned by the other
    player!). Piling On does not cause a turnover unless the Piling On player is carrying the ball.
    Piling On cannot be used with the Stab or Chainsaw skills.</p>
